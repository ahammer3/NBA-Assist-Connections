# NBA-Assist-Connections
In this short little project I tried my hand at looking at assists for the 2019 NBA season. I suspect that it can translate to any season, and that anyone as well can quickly pick up the code and use it. It helped practice a variety of techniques such as web scraping, data mangling, visualizations, and more. I hope it's just as interesting to everyone else as it was to me!

TODO:
1) Fix some issues where text blocks would overlap with names
2) Configure in unassisted data to see juxtapositions
3) Better color schemes and aethetics overall
